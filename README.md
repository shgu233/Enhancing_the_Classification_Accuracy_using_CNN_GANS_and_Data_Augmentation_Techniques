# Enhancing the Classification Accuracy using CNN, GANs, and data Augmentation Techniques
Generating cat images through gan's to balance my imabalnce dataset.
This is the official repository for the research paper "Enhancing the Classification Accuracy using CNN, 
GANs, and data Augmentation Techniques", (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10393694) containg all the codes for the training and testing codes of te GANS model traianed for the enhancing the CNN models for the unbalanced dataset problem. Japkowicz and Stephen (2002 class) have 
thoroughly studied and investigated the class imbalance problem and also analyzed its causes and impacts on different 
classifiers, and presented no. of different strategies to handle 
the imbalanced data sets effectively. Yang et al. (2018) have examined and studied the application of transfer learning 
for the purpose of improving the performance of imbalanced 
datasets. 

The proposed methodology was evaluated on a data set 
consisting of 10,000 dog images and 4,000 cat images, with 
a class imbalance. The performance of the classification 
model was assessed using standard evaluation metrics, 
including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The initial 
training of the CNN classification model on the imbalanced 
data set resulted in an accuracy of 93.54 % on the test set. This 
indicated the presence of a significant bias towards the 
majority class (dogs) in the data set. To address the class 
imbalance issue, we applied data augmentation techniques. By 
augmenting the data set with 6,000 synthetic cat images, we 
aimed to achieve a more balanced distribution between the 
two classes.
